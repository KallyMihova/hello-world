# hello-world
A place where I store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others.
I am a second year GDD student at RIT. 
Originally from Bulgaria, moved to the states roughtly 5 years ago and since then have been focused on combining my hobbies with what I learn and that is how I found my passion for game development. 
I have 2 siblings and a cat called Mr.Bean. He's the best.
